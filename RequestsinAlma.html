<div class="sierra">
In Sierra we had 20 or 30 statuses that might help to understand the location of an item that was not on Avaible or checked out.
</div>

<div class="sierra">
In Sierra request was understood to be one thing, a patron hold request.
</div>

<div class="alma">
In Alma there are two base statuses, either In Place and Not In Place which means that is "In Process" of some kind
There are also several out-of-the-box statuses such as Missing, Lost, Claims Returned, etc.
</div>

<div class="alma">
There are a variety of requests but the term request more specifically is a patron initiated request to hold an item
Work orders are sare a type of request (for work), but are staff initiated, not patrons
Work orders help faciltate the movement and location of items that are "In Process"
</div>

Request/Procress Type
Binding, General Hold Request, Move Permanently, Move Temporarily, 
Patron Physical Item Request, Patron Digitization Request, 
Restore Item, and Transit for Reshelving
A work order type is a "process" with one or more statuses that are usually defined by the staff/work that needs to be done
Work order processes are Acquisitions, Preservation, Digitization



A work order department can be thought of as internal location (or function) in Alma.
A work order department in Alma is really the staff authorized to handle the work of that department.

Alma has two out-of the-box "locations" to handle basic workflows:

The Acquisitions Department is where new materials are received.  
You must have the Receiving Operator role to receive items, change their status, or mark them as Done
After being Received, and the Keep in Dept. box is checked, The item remains in CATS for further processing
it has a request attached to it, the assumption that being kept in the dept. for a purpose

The Circulation Desk is a "desk" with services  such as shelving, checkin checkout
It also has a hold shelf, currently we do not enable "hold shelf processing" which would enable the desk to function more as a work order dept, i.e., items scanned in that
have requests would not immediately go to the hold shelf, rather another process
Circulation desks also can have work order types added to them





Monitor Requests and In Process Items, you will see all requests for your department
if you have the Receiving Operator role this list is identical to the Post-Receiving Processing list

Work order types can span departments, even libraries
So two depts can share the same type, or "Process"

Request types: In Process (staff initiated, work order), Request (typically patron intiated)
Request operators are attached to a circulation desk
Work order operators to work order depts
Receiving operators to acquisitions depts



Workflow Steps: Await Approval, Deposit Item, Document Delivery, Requested, 
On Hold Shelf, Transit Item, Work Order, and Pickup From Shelf





Why bother?

Having defined processes enable our patrons and other staff to understand when a item is not on the shelf
It helps staff within a dept see where an item is and to know when the item needs their attention

A simple example:
A staff person notices a spine label falling off a book on the shelf.  They decide to bring the book to technical services
hopefuly for a quick repair.  Do we need a work order type with a department and a status?  Maybe.  It seems we might get by without 
one.  But Carol may be on vacation.  Or it might be decided the book needs more repair.  

A work order department for preservation


[Quick way]
Select the Department in Alma "Schaffer Library - Preservation Dept"  (serves all three libraries)
Ctrl + Alt + S – Open the Scanning interface, enter barcode
Choose Status - there is currently just one status for this Dept, "In Repair"

[this generates a request for the preservation/repair department]
in Alma where there is a list of item records click the row actions list (...) and select "Work Order"
a physical items search will generate a list of items, another type of search, such as titles will have "Items" in the row actions list, select that to get to the item list
once at an item choose row actions -> Work order
then choose "Preservation' as the "Process Type" and the mamaging dept. autofills "Preservation/Repair"
assuming the item is in hand check the "do not pick from shelf" to avoid that workflow step
if it is on the shelf leaving the box unchecked will create a request


Select the Department in Alma "Schaffer Library - Preeservation Dept"  (serves all three libraries)
Go to Fulfillment -> Manage In-Process Items
Change the status from none to "In Repair"

Primo shows:
In process of Preservation until 08/24/2018
Currently defaulting to 7 days....I'll ask India what shethinks

Alt + P – Open the Pick From Shelf interface
