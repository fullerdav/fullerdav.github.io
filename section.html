<header><h1>Why on earth are we going to the cloud?</h1></header>

<section>
 <div class="container" id="cloud">

<div class="item">
Sierra is expensive, and the company is not what it used to be.
<hr width="100%" />
Sierra hasn't changed or developed in years but the world (and libraries) have changed a lot.
</div>
 
<div  class="item">
We will no longer need to pay for and maintain hardware, perform tape backups or sytem upgrades.
<hr width="100%" />
By moving to Alma we will be paying less for a system that supports our work/goals/mission better.
</div>

 <div class="item">
 We used to be a building full of print books and journals.
<hr width="100%" />
 We still have an important collection of print materials but our virtual collections need to be managed.  
<hr width="100%" />
 It's a complicated and Sierra isn't helping very much.
</div>

<header><h1>But why Alma?</h1></header>
<section>

<div class="container" id="whyalma">

<div class="item">
Our only viable choices were Alma (Ex Libris) or WMS (OCLC)
<hr width="100%" />
EBSCO is developing a product called "Folio" which sounds appealing but still a long way from ready.  
<hr width="100%" />
There are open-source options which we ruled out mainly because of support.
</div>

<div class="item">
Vendor visited, we made our own site visits and spoke to a sample of other sites running each system.  <br />
We spoke to trusted contacts and looked at our peers (Oberlin Group libraries).
</div>

<div class="item">
Among the Oberlin Group there is roughly an even divide between libraries that have chosen Alma or WMS to date.  <br />
But the sample size is small and most of the Obie Group is still mired with Sierra.
<hr width="100%" />
Our expediture per FTE (which is relatively high) places us in a cohort of Obie Group libraries that have chosen Alma.
</div>

<div class="item">
  Expenditure per FTE is a measure of our commitment to undergraduate research. <br /> 
  It was reassuring that we are in the top tier of Obie group libraries.  
<hr width="100%" />
  I also noticed that we are in the upper third in ILL lending, which might be a sign of the quality of our collection.
</div>

<div class="item">
Most of our peers that have chosen WMS made the choice before 2015, three years ago or more.  
<hr width="100%" />
The recent trend seems to be toward Alma.  Last year, nationwide, 80% of academic libriaries chose Alma.
</div>

<header><h1>What can we expect?</h1></header>
<section>

<div class="container"  id="expect">

<div class="item">
  The system is more integrated than anything we've ever had.  
<hr width="100%" />
Many things that have been scattered will be in one place.
<hr width="100%" />
  The discovery layer, "Summon" is the search interface sitting on top of all our resources.   
</div>

<div class="item">
  The "catalog" will be quite different.  While our MARC records will still be in there they will be interfiled with other types of records.  
<hr width="100%" />
  It will be called our "Institution Zone", (at least that's what it wants to be called).
</div> 

<div class="item">
  ERM is now URM, "Universal Resource Management."
<hr width="100%" />
  Lists of databases, even an A-Z list can be generated directly from our Institution Zone.
</div>

<div class="item">
  The system will be able to exchange data more easily with other systems, vendors, campus systems, etc.
<hr width="100%" /> 
  Many ILL requests can be initiated directly by the patron.
<hr width="100%" />
Analytic tools can measure our collections and usage to better understand what we do and communicate our value
to the rest of the campus.
